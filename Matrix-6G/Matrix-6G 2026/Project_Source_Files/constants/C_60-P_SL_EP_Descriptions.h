on before LFO 1 will periodically trigger the envelope’s cycle.

run through the delay, attack, and decay stages, then hold at the sustain level.
Gating off the note will immediately trigger the release stage, even if the 
sustain stage has not yet been reached.

after the decay stage, whether or not the voice is still gated on. Gating off
the voice before the other stages complete will also start the release stage.

decay, and release stages, whether or not the note is kept gated on. Keeping
the note gated on will hold the sustain level normally.

the envelope is re-triggered before its cycle completes, the cycle restarts.

the envelope and restart it from the beginning of its cycle.

assigning each newly played note to the next available voice.

only one note can be played at a time. If multiple notes are played
